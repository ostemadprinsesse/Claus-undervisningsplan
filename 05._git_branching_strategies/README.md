# Git branching strategies

## Before Class
Be sure that you have a basic understanding of git commands (and be sure that you can use them through the CLI).

Each group must show their work in the beginning of this class. You all have around 3 minutes max. Prepare this task before class.    

Fokus on:     
* the running application (frontend, api and openapi docs)
* show your repository and explain the folders and files from an architectual point of veiw.

### Weekly DevOps Principle!
**Reduce WIP (Work In Progress)**,     
**Reduce Batch size**  

* Avoid large batch sizes.    
* Limit active branches. 
* Merge branches to trunk at least daily.
* Avoid long-lived branches.
