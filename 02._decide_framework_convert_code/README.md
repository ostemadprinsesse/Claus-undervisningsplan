# Exam project - Decide on a framework & convert code
The outcome of today's teachings is that your **group organization** on GitHub is set up and you have made an initial commit to your exam project repository. This repository's URL should be shared in the [groups.py](../groups.py) file.

You have also set up a Kanban board in a GitHub project, and you have started creating an OpenAPI specification in your framework for your REST API in the application.

This requires that before these teachings, you have [formed a group](../01._introduction/01._github_started.md). 

## Learning Goals
* Be able to decide on a language and a framework for your exam project.
* Be able to use Swagger Editor and Postman for working with OpenAPI spec documents.
* Understand the three first parts of "The principle of flow":
    1. Make your work **visible**
    2. **Limit** work in process (**WIP**)
    3. **Reduce batch sizes**
* Be aware of where and how the principle of flow is used in today's teachings
* Set up a Kanban Board in a GitHub project
* Add OpenAPI documentation to your own codebase using the framework's tools
* Understand monolithic, mono-repo, multi-repo concepts.
* Understand the concept of conventions in terms of DevOps and software development.
